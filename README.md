# CNN_Caption_Generator
Built a model using deep learning techniques that can generate meaningful textual descriptions from a given Input Image.

## [Deployed Model](https://anj47-cnn-caption-generator.hf.space/)

## Overview
Image caption generation involves two main components:

Image Feature Extraction: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to extract high-level features from images. A pre-trained CNN model, typically trained on large image datasets like ImageNet, is used for this purpose. These features provide a meaningful representation of the image content.

Text Generation: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are employed to generate captions based on the extracted image features. The RNN learns to generate sequential text descriptions that are coherent and contextually relevant to the input image. 


1. Clone this repository:

	`` shell

	git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-caption-generator.git
	cd image-caption-generator
	``

2. Install the required dependencies:

	`` 
	pip install -r requirements.txt ``


3. Download the pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16) weights and place them in the models directory.


4. Prepare your dataset. This repository assumes a specific dataset structure. Make sure to organize your images and captions accordingly.


5. Customize the configuration settings in config.py to match your dataset and training preferences.


## Model Architecture

The model architecture for this image caption generator typically consists of:

-Encoder (CNN): A pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) is used to extract image features. The output of the CNN is flattened and then passed through a Dense layer to create the initial hidden state for the decoder.

-Decoder (RNN): The decoder is an RNN (LSTM or GRU) that generates captions word by word. It takes the image features as input and generates one word at a time until an end token is predicted.

-Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors.

-Attention Mechanism: An attention mechanism is often used to focus on different parts of the image while generating each word in the caption.

## Example 

Here's an example of how to use this image caption generator:

	``
	from image_caption_generator import ImageCaptionGenerator

	# Load the trained model
	generator = ImageCaptionGenerator.load_model('model_weights.h5')

	# Generate a caption for a new image
	caption = generator.generate_caption('path/to/your/image.jpg')
	print(caption)
	``
