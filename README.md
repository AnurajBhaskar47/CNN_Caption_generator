## Overview
Image caption generation involves two main components:

Image Feature Extraction: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to extract high-level features from images. A pre-trained CNN model, typically trained on large image datasets like ImageNet, is used for this purpose. These features provide a meaningful representation of the image content.

Text Generation: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are employed to generate captions based on the extracted image features. The RNN learns to generate sequential text descriptions that are coherent and contextually relevant to the input image.
